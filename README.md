This repository contains the following:
  - A comprehensive vocabulary for the Greek language, especially formatted for input to the open-source software, IRaMuTeQ, which is used to analyse large textual corpora. The vocabulary was built using OpenOffice's Greek dictionary, which was parsed through the Spacy NLP pre-trained model for Greek language and with precious help from Prokopis Prokopidis of the Athena Research and Innovation Center. 
  - A comprehensive (perhaps the longest) stopword list for the Greek language. 

Work done by Charis Papaevangelou & Panos Tsimboukis of the LERASS laboratory at the University of Toulouse Paul Sabatier.
